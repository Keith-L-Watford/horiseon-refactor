# <Horiseon Refactor>
## Description
I've been assigned to refactor a website for the company, Horiseon. Mostly everything in the code worked as it was supposed to, but it was a little hard to follow because of the extensive use of the vauge div tag. I mostly, specified those tags, and added some alt tags for the images. Working on this reinforced for me that once an elemental tag is renamed in the .html, it's link to the .css file needs to be changed accordingly as well.
